  title: Who Am I
  description: "I'm Aadarsh Raj, I build what others call impossible \u2014 ultra-fast
    trading engines, AI models that adapt in real time, and platforms that scale
    to millions without breaking.\n\nFrom 11th globally in Google Code-In to founding
    an AI startup with 8,000+ users worldwide, I\u2019ve proven I don\u2019t just
    dream \u2014 I deliver.\n\nI\u2019ve shipped products that move millions of dollars
    daily, stopped fraud with 96% accurate ML systems, and built AI pipelines that
    continuously self-improve.\n\nEvery challenge is fuel \u2014 the harder it gets,
    the sharper I perform.\nI don\u2019t follow roadmaps, I create them \u2014 turning
    complex AI research and engineering chaos into elegant, production-grade systems.\n\nSpeed,
    precision, and scalability aren\u2019t buzzwords for me \u2014 they\u2019re my
    baseline.\n\nWhether it\u2019s foundation models, RAG systems, or blockchain-integrated
    AI, I push technology beyond its limits.\n\nI\u2019m not applying for a job \u2014
    I\u2019m here to be the AI-driven unfair advantage your company never had before.\n"
