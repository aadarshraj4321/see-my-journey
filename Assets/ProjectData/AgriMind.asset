  title: 'Project: AgriMind: Foundation Model for Agricultural AI '
  description: "Built a 150M-parameter Transformer from scratch, trained on domain-specific
    agricultural data to deliver real-time, ground-level insights.\n\nDesigned a
    dual-pass RAG pipeline that grounds outputs in verified knowledge, cutting hallucinations
    and boosting trust.\n\nBenchmarked against Llama-3-8B fine-tunes, proving domain
    models can outperform giants in targeted use-cases.\n\nEnabled farmers and enterprises
    to make climate-smart, data-driven decisions with precision.\n\nAgriMind is not
    just an AI model \u2014 it\u2019s the blueprint for how foundation models can
    transform entire industries."
