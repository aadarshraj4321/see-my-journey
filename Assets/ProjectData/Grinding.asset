  title: 'Why You Should Hire Me '
  description: "I\u2019m not just a developer \u2014 I\u2019m a debugger and problem-solver
    who thrives on fixing what others can\u2019t.\n\nFrom scaling AI startups to
    architecting trading platforms, I\u2019ve proven I can deliver real-world, production-grade
    solutions.\n\nI debug systems at scale, whether it\u2019s code, infrastructure,
    or data pipelines, and make them run faster and smarter.\n\nRanked globally in
    Google Code-in and awarded in national innovation contests, I bring both skill
    and creativity.\n\nI turn complex problems into simple, scalable solutions that
    actually work in production.\nHiring me means adding someone who doesn\u2019t
    just code \u2014 I solve, fix, and make systems unbreakable."
