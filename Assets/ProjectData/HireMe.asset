  title: Why Hire Me
  description: "Because I don\u2019t just build for today \u2014 I build for what\u2019s
    next.\n\nI\u2019ve engineered systems that already run at millions in scale,
    and I\u2019m only getting started.\n\nEvery project I touch \u2014 from AI pipelines
    that self-learn to platforms used in 25+ countries \u2014 proves I can turn vision
    into impact.\n\nI don\u2019t stop at solving problems \u2014 I anticipate the
    future and design solutions that last.\n\nI bring the edge of AI research, the
    precision of engineering, and the hunger of a founder who won\u2019t quit.\n\nHiring
    me isn\u2019t about filling a role \u2014 it\u2019s about securing the person
    who will push your company into the future before others even see it coming."
