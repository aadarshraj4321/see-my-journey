  title: 'Project: Autonomous Learning System For Large Language Models'
  description: 'Engineered a self-correcting LLM pipeline using DPO + LoRA fine-tuning
    for continuous real-time improvement.


    Integrated a RAG-based grounding
    system, reducing hallucinations while boosting factual accuracy.


    Built
    a preference-tuning engine to transform raw user feedback into structured datasets.


    Deployed
    an automated evaluation pipeline with A/B testing and LLM-as-a-Judge scoring
    for reliable performance tracking.'
