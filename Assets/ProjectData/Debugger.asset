  title: 'Most Important For Me Is: Debugging'
  description: "I\u2019m a Debugger \u2014 I don\u2019t just write code, I break
    problems until they surrender.\n\nWhen systems fail, I see patterns others miss
    and fix what no one else can.\nI\u2019ve debugged trading engines under 5ms latency,
    AI pipelines that self-correct, and platforms serving thousands globally.\n\nProblems
    aren\u2019t roadblocks for me \u2014 they\u2019re puzzles I\u2019m built to solve.\nHire
    me, and you don\u2019t just get a developer \u2014 you get the problem-solver
    your team calls when nothing else works."
