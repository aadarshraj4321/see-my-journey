  title: 'Project: Fasalytics: Multi-Agent AI for Climate-Smart Farming'
  description: 'Engineered a multi-agent reinforcement learning system that optimizes
    irrigation, fertilization, and pest control for smarter farming.


    Developed
    a probabilistic weather forecasting engine using LSTM ensembles to deliver uncertainty-aware
    7-day forecasts.


    Integrated 16+ data variables including soil, climate,
    and crop health metrics to drive precise decision-making.


    Built a data
    ingestion pipeline processing multi-year climate records into actionable datasets.


    Fasalytics
    empowers farmers with AI-driven climate resilience, reducing risks and maximizing
    yield.'
